# TypeScript QuickStart Source

This repository holds the basic TypeScript source code and potentially a good starting point for your application.

It's been extended with testing support so you can start writing tests immediately.

## How to start?

```
    git clone https://github.com/debasispanda/typescript-quickstart.git
    
    cd typescript-quickstart

    npm install

    npm start  # to start the application

    npm test   # run unit test

    npm run build  # build the application code

```
